# YOLOv8 Object Detection on Heridal Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on training a YOLOv8 model using the Heridal dataset and the ultralytics framework. The goal is to achieve accurate object detection on the Heridal dataset and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Dataset

The Heridal dataset is a curated collection of images and corresponding bounding box annotations for object detection tasks. It covers a wide range of objects across different categories, providing diverse and representative samples for training and evaluation.

## Results

The pretrained YOLOv8 model achieved the following metrics on the Heridal dataset:

    Precision: 0.636
    Recall: 0.502
    Mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP50): 0.549
    Mean Average Precision from IoU 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50-95): 0.211
    Frames per Second (FPS): 142.86

These metrics demonstrate the performance of the pretrained YOLOv8 model in accurately detecting objects in the Heridal dataset.
